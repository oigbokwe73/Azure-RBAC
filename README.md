# Azure-RBAC

Hereâ€™s a Mermaid sequence diagram that illustrates the process of using two service principals with different RBAC roles for creating resource groups and assigning roles:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SP1 as Service Principal 1 (Limited RBAC)
    participant SP2 as Service Principal 2 (Contributor)
    participant RG as Resource Group
    participant Azure as Azure Resource Manager

    SP1->>Azure: Request to create Resource Group
    Azure->>SP1: Resource Group Creation Successful
    SP1->>RG: Resource Group Created
    
    SP2->>Azure: Request to assign Contributor Role to SP1
    Azure->>SP2: Role Assignment Successful
    SP2->>Azure: Request to create resources in Resource Group
    Azure->>SP2: Resource Creation Successful
    SP2->>RG: Resources Created
```

### Explanation:
1. **Service Principal 1 (SP1)** has a limited RBAC role that allows it to create **Resource Groups**.
2. **Service Principal 2 (SP2)** has a Contributor role, which gives it permissions to assign roles to others and create resources in the Resource Group.
3. **SP1** requests to create a resource group, and once created, it can interact with the Resource Group.
4. **SP2** assigns the Contributor role to **SP1** so that it can manage resources within the Resource Group.
5. **SP2** then creates the necessary resources in the Resource Group, leveraging its permissions.

This diagram illustrates how Service Principals with distinct roles can interact with Azure resources by adhering to the RBAC model.
